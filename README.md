# tsclient

`tsclient` is an alternative Go client for [Typesense](https://typesense.org/).

**Why not [the official client](https://github.com/typesense/typesense-go)?** We didn't like it, that's all.
This client is a lot more similar in usage to Arikawa, the Discord library used in Termora.

**WARNING:** this is a *heavy* work in progress! The API may change at any time.
